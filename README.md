# FarmEase-BackEnd

Farm Ease is a web application designed to help farmers manage their equipment inventory. This project allows farmers to add, update, and view equipment items, check their availability, and keep track of their ownership. Farm Ease is built using Spring Boot and provides a user-friendly interface for farmers to manage their equipment effortlessly.

## Features

- **Update Equipment:** Farmers can edit existing equipment details, including name, description, price, and availability.
- **View Equipment:** Farmers can view a list of all equipment items, along with their details and availability status.
- **Track Ownership:** Each equipment item is associated with a specific owner (a farmer), allowing farmers to track their equipment ownership.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot:** The project is built using the Spring Boot framework, providing a robust and scalable backend for the application.
- **Java Persistence API (JPA):** JPA is used for database interaction, allowing seamless integration with the underlying database.
- **PostgreSql:** An in-memory H2 database is used for storing equipment and farmer data during development.
